\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Eigenvalue problems occur frequently in mathematics and science. Many problems
are on or can be re-written to the form
\begin{align*}
  A \mathbf{x} = \lambda \mathbf{x}
\end{align*}
For matrices where $n \geq 5$ there is
no general analytical procedure to obtain the roots of the characteristic polynomial, by the
Abel-Ruffini theorem. In most situations the eigenvalue problems have much
larger matrices, on the order \(n\sim 10\), and numerical algorithms are needed to solve the problems. In
this paper, the direct Jacobi rotation and built-in methods in Julia and the C++
library armadillo are used to solve eigenvalue problems. This project was implemented
in two programming languages for several reasons. First of all, it is very relevant to
learn several programming languages, and for future projects it is interesting
to compare execution speeds for the same algorithm.

The methods are used to solve Schrödinger's equation for two electrons in a
three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential, which can be reformulated into
an eigenvalue problem through scaling and mathematical manipulations. The
energy eigenvalues and associated eigenstates are then obtained by Jacobi's method,
and compared to known analytic solutions.

The study of electrons confined in a potential is a highly active research field,
because of the possible nano-medical applications, and in the development of semi-conductors
and quantum computers.
\section{Theory}
\label{sec:theory}
\subsection{Jacobi's rotation algorithm}
The general idea of Jacobi's algorithm is rather straightforward. Finding the
eigenvalues of any matrix is hard, but finding the eigenvalues of a diagonal
matrix is trivial. A matrix \(A\) is converted to an approximately a diagonal
matrix through a series of orthogonal matrix transformations on the form:
\begin{align*}
  T = S^T A S
\end{align*}
where $S$ is a rotation matrix. This amounts to rotating the rotating the matrix
around hyperplanes in such a way that the off-diagonal elements are reduced to
fall beneath some threshhold.
Since eigenvalues are preserved under similarity
transformations, the eigenvalues of \(A\) can be read off the diagonal of a
sufficiently diagonalized matrix. For a more detailed description, see REF.

There are several ways to iterate through the matrix to eliminate the offdiagonal
elements, for instance a full systematic iteration over all matrix elements. In this paper,
the maximum offdiagonal element is found and eliminated in each iteration, which can be shown to be
the method which provides the fastest convergence to the solution. The disadvantage of this method
is that finding the largest offdiagonal element is a cumbersome task for large matrices.
\subsection{The Harmonic Oscillator}
\label{sec:harmonic}
In the words of Richard Feynman, ``every potential can be reduced to a
combination of harmonic oscillators'' REF. The harmonic oscillator is an
integral part of quantum mechanics, and is the bread and butter when solving
complex potentials numerically. As such, it is necessary to understand how the
Hamiltonian of a harmonic oscillator is discretized to make it solvable
numerically.

The radial part of Schrödinger's
equation describing an electron in an harmonic oscillator is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:schroedinger}
  -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m} \left( \frac{1}{r^{2}}\dv{r}r^{2}\dv{r} - \frac{l(l+1)}{r^{2}} \right) + VR = ER
\end{equation}
with potential
\begin{equation*}
  V(r) = \frac{1}{2}mω^{2}r^{2}
\end{equation*}
and energies
\begin{equation*}
  E_{nl} = \hbar\omega\left( 2n+l+\frac{3}{2} \right)
\end{equation*}
with \(n=0,1,2,\ldots\) and \(l = 0,1,2,\ldots\)

\eqref{eq:schroedinger} can be scaled and rewritten to a more practical form:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:scaledschroedinger}
  -\dv[2]{\rho}u(\rho)+\rho^{2}u(\rho) = \lambda u(\rho)
\end{equation}
see REF for a more detailed derivation. To solve this equation numerically,
\(\dv[2]{u}{\rho}\) is computed as
\begin{equation*}
  \dv[2]{u}{\rho} \simeq \frac{u(\rho+h)-2u(\rho)+u(\rho-h)}{h^{2}} + \mathcal{O}(h^{2})
\end{equation*}
where \(h\) is the step size. Minimal and maximal values are set for \(\rho\).
As the position can not be negative, \(\rho_{min}=0\). Ideally,
\(\rho_{max}=\infty\), but as this is impractical on a computer, it is instead
set to some very, very high number, such as \(\rho_{max}=10\). The continuum between
\(\rho_{min}\) and \(\rho_{max}\) is discretized into \(N\) mesh points by
renaming \(\rho_{min}=\rho_{0}\) and \(\rho_{max}=\rho_{N}\) and letting
\(\rho_{i}\) be defined as
\begin{equation*}
  \rho_{i} = \rho_{0}+ih\qquad i=1,2,\ldots,N
\end{equation*}
and \(h\) is
\begin{equation*}
  h = \frac{\rho_{N}-\rho_{0}}{N}
\end{equation*}
Schroedinger's equation can now be rewritten as
\begin{equation*}
  - \frac{u_{i+1}-2u_{i}+u_{i-1}}{h^{2}} + V_{i}u_{i} = \lambda u_{i}
\end{equation*}
This can be further simplified to
\begin{equation*}
  d_{i}u_{i}+e_{i-1}u_{i-1}+e_{i+1}u_{i+1} = \lambda u_{i}
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{equation*}
  d_{i} = \frac{2}{h^{2}} + V_{i}
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
  e_{i}= \frac{1}{h^{2}}
\end{equation*}

This equation allows itself to be written onto matrix form as
\begin{equation}\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{$
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{2}{h^{2}}+V1 & -\frac{1}{h^{2}}      & 0                & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
    -\frac{1}{h^{2}}   & \frac{2}{h^{2}}+V_{2} & -\frac{1}{h^{2}} & 0  & \cdots & 0 \\
    0 & \frac{1}{h^{2}} & \frac{2}{h^{2}} + V_{3} & -\frac{1}{h^{2}}  &  \cdots & 0 \\
    \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    \vdots & \ddots & \ddots&  -\frac{1}{h^{2}} & \frac{2}{h^{2}}+V_{N-2} & -\frac{1}{h^{2}} \\
    0 & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots & -\frac{1}{h^{2}} & \frac{2}{h^{2}} + V_{N-1} \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  $}\label{eq:bigbadmatrix}
\end{equation}

This is a general form which holds for all potentials of harmonic oscillators.
When solving for the plain harmonic oscillator potential, the potential terms are simply
\(V_{i}=\rho_{i}^{2}\). Adding on the repulsive Coulomb potential, the total potential
becomes \(V_{i}=\omega_{r}\rho_{i}^{2}+1/\rho_{i}^{2}\), where \(\omega_{r}\) is
a frequency describing the strength of the Coulomb interaction. See Ref for a complete computation.

In order to find the probability of finding the electron(s) at any given
position, the wavefunction describing the state of the electron(s) must be
found. These are the eigenvectors of the matrix~\eqref{eq:bigbadmatrix}, while
the eigenvalues describe the energy of the state. The probability is then
obtained by squaring the eigenvectors.
\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

\subsection{Solving the Hamiltonian}
The Hamiltonian solved here describes two electrons trapped in an harmonic oscillator with
two different types of potential. In the first case, only the potential of the
harmonic oscillator is
acting on the electron, while in the second, the electrons also feel a repulsive Coulomb
interaction from each other.

To find the wave functions describing the position of the electrons, the matrix
described above in REF is set up for some values \(\rho_{\text{min}},
\rho_{\text{max}}, N\) and \(\omega_{r}\).
\subsection{Choice of $\omega_r$ to analyze}
Several values for $\omega_r$ were used in this project to investigate how the
potential impacts the relative wave function of the electrons. Specifically,
analytical eigenvalues for this exact problem (M. Taut, 1993) are compared
to the algorithm results.
\subsection{Choosing appropriate boundary values}
The boundary values for this problems are set at $0$ and infinity. In the
implementation of this problem a numerical value is set for $\rho_\text{max} = \infty$.
This value was tested for each $\omega_r$, and set at a point large enough
so that the solution doesnt change noticably on changing $\rho_\text{max}$.
To avoid division by zero, $\rho_\text{min}$ was set to a small positive value.
\subsection{Multiple programming languages}
In this project the Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm was implemented in both Julia and
C++. The computation speeds of the Jacobi eigenvalue implementations
and the built in eigenvalue solvers in both languages were compared.
\subsection{Unit tests}
Unit tests were implemented to verify that the implemented functions behave
as intended, and that this behaviour is preserved through changes to the programs.

In one of the tests, the function which finds the maximum offdiagonal element
is tested with a $50 \times 50$ random matrix with one element modified to a
much larger value.

The implementation of the full Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm is also tested on a
$3 \times 3$ matrix with known eigenvalues.
\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{The Algorithm}
\label{sec:algorithm}

As the code was written on both Python+C++ and Julia, there were two sets of
results. Since all of the results agree, only one set of results is included.
The exception to this is the algorithm itself, which although equivalent, behave
a bit differently.

Figure~\ref{fig:juliatiming} compares the time it takes for the handwritten
Jacobi algorithm to find to eigenvalues of an \(N\times N\)-matrix, versus the
time it takes for the standard library methods to do the same. The Jacobi method
is written in both Julia and C++, while the standard Julia method and Armadillo
method are used as comparison. Only the memory consumption in Julia is measured
as C++ provides no easy way to measure this.

    \(N\times N\)-matrix for the custom Jacobi method versus library methods. In
  the upper plot, the green dashed line of Julia's eigenvalue solver is hidden
  by the overlaying Armadillo's purple dashed line.}
\end{figure}

The number of similarity transforms needed to make all off-diagonal elements
less than \(\varepsilon=10^{-10}\) as \(N\) grows is plotted in
figure~\ref{fig:juliaiterations}.

\end{figure}

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{The Algorithm}
Viewing figure~\ref{fig:juliatiming}, it is abundantly clear that the standard
library methods of both Julia and Armadillo are far superior to the custom
Jacobi methods, being both quicker and using less memory. More interestingly,
the Jacobi method written in Julia is quicker than the method written in C++.
The reason for this is unknown.

The Jacobi method takes considerably longer as the mesh size increases. From
figure~\ref{fig:juliaiterations} , the time needed grows approximately as
\(2.2\cdot 10^{-3}N^{3}\), at least as \(0\leq N \leq 200\). This renders
Jacobi's method completely useless at sufficiently large \(N\)s.

\subsection{Impact of Couloumb repulsion}
From figure REF it is clear that when the Coulomb interaction is added to the
Hamiltonian, the wavefunction shifts to larger $\rho$.
It clear that for larger $\omega_r$ the harmonic oscillator dominates the repulsion
and the wavefunctions are much closer. For small $\omega_r$ the repulsion
has a much larger impact and pushes the wavefunction further away from the origin.
This behaviour is as expected.
\label{sec:discussion}
\section{Conclusion}
The solution to Schrödinger's equation for two electrons in an external
harmonic oscillator was found using Jacobi's eigenvalue algorithm and built-in
algorithms in Julia and C++. The results are consistent with analytic eigenvalues
by M. Taut and intuition about the problem. The Jacobi eigenvalue method is
numerically stable for reasonable limits $\rho_\text{max}$ and $\rho_\text{min}$,
and a wide array of $\omega_r$.

\section{Proof of preservation of orthogonality and dot product for unitary transformations}
A unitary transformation preserves orthogonality and the dot product. To see
this, consider an orthogonal basis \(\{\vb{v}_{i}\}\) and an unitary
transformation \(U\). Defining \(\vb{w}_{i}=U\vb{v}_{i}\), the dot product can
be computed as
\begin{align*}
  \vb{w}_{i}\vdot \vb{w}_{j} &= \vb{w}_{i}\vb{w}_{j}^{T}\\
                             &= \left( U\vb{v}_{i} \right)\left( U\vb{v}_{j} \right)^{T}\\
                             &= U\vb{v}_{i}\vb{v}_{j}^{T}U^{T}\\
                             &= U\delta_{ij}U^{T}\\
                             &= \delta_{ij}UU^{T}\\
                             &= \delta_{ij}
\end{align*}
where the last step follows since \(U\) is unitary.
